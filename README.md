# VideoConferencing
A Video Conferencing Web Application.

As Chrome,FireFox and Safari browsers support WebRTC API interface, I want to build a simple web application that can perform video conferencing.

Currently, I am building front end with React framework and bootstrap, I am using Express to build backend.

Although I have some experience on web programming e.g. jquery,javascript,jsp,asp,php , all of the above technologies are new to me.

Especially, I am not familiar with CSS, so if you are familiar with bootstrap and css, you are the one I am looking for,
if you have interest on my project, please send me an email(i.e. knvbhk@gmail.com), I looking for your help, thank you very much.
